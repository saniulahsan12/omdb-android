# omdb-android
Its a primary working phase on working with android studio and java. I did this on learning purpose and used recycler view, volley and some android widgets. Basically this app contains a splash screen and requires a login for a new user and gives the user to search for movies, series and shows in recycler view. After that it shows a detailed information of the topic on click.
